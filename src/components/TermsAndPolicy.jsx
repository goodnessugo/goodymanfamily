                    We implement strong technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or loss. While we strive to safeguard your information, no digital platform is entirely risk-free, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

                    Protecting children’s privacy is especially important in education. GoodyMan’s services are designed for learners of various age groups, but accounts for children under the age of 13 must be created and managed with parental or guardian consent, in compliance with applicable data protection laws. We do not knowingly collect data from children without such consent.
